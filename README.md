中文：这个是架设人脸识别服务的整个的源代码，模型需要自己去找照片来训练，本来想放上来的，但是文件太大传不了，所以只能你们自己去训练模型，可以用官方的照片集来训练。包含一个BS的展示系统（前端：H5，js，jquery，ajax，css，tracking.js等，后台：java+JSP+redis，以webservice提供服务）和提供人脸识别的服务，这个服务使用python开发，基于facenet，这个系统是我多年前（约2018年）自己基于facenet开发的，现在把源代码公开出来，由于暂时没有时间，所以直接公开，未做代码调整和优化，希望对技术传播有所助益。本代码公开纯属技术交流，没有收取任何费用。 English:This is the entire source code for setting up face recognition services.The model needs to find photos to train by yourself. I originally wanted to put them on, but the file is too large to transmit, so you can only train the model by yourself. You can use the official photo collection to train. It includes a BS system (front-end: H5, JS, jQuery, AJAX, CSS, tracking.js, etc., back-end: java,jsp,redis, etc, which provides services with WebService )and provides face recognition services. This service is developed using Python and based on facenet. This system was developed by myself based on facenet many years ago (about 2018). Now the source code is open. Because there is no time for now, it is directly open, The code has not been adjusted and optimized, and I hope it will be helpful to the dissemination of technology. The disclosure of this code is purely technical exchange, and no fee is charged.
